**STORYTIME**
Storytime is a storytelling app inspired by an improv warm up game where performers make short, declarative statements
before passing the mic to the next person to continue the story in whatever way they see fit. Users can create new stories,
view and add comments to existing stories, and delete and update their own comments so long as they are the most recent comment
in the story. 

**WIREFRAME**

**NEXT STEPS**
Future improves include:
  - Implementing an upvote type system for peoples favorite stories.
  - Working on the display a bit; I like the vibe but it's hard to read when text overlaps the fire.
  - Improve delete parameters, you should only be able to delete if you are user AND most recent comment, to help maintain story integrity.
  - Displaying user names and timestamps next to comments.
  - Implement logic to show how many characters are remaining in form submission.
  - Form boxes currently one of the only non-responsives elements on the site, need to fix this.
  - Make the music play more fluidly from page to page and add different songs.
